# Xenhypfs Paths

This document attempts to define all the paths which are available
in the Xen hypervisor file system (hypfs).

The hypervisor file system can be accessed via the xenhypfs tool.

## Notation

The hypervisor file system is similar to the Linux kernel's sysfs.
In this document directories are always specified with a trailing "/".

The following notation conventions apply:

        DIRECTORY/

        PATH = VALUES [TAGS]

The first syntax defines a directory. It normally contains related
entries and the general scope of the directory is described.

The second syntax defines a file entry containing values which are
either set by the hypervisor or, if the file is writable, can be set
by the user.

PATH can contain simple regex constructs following the Perl compatible
regexp syntax described in pcre(3) or perlre(1).

A hypervisor file system entry name can be any 0-delimited byte string
not containing any '/' character. The names "." and ".." are reserved
for file system internal use.

VALUES are strings and can take the following forms:

* STRING -- an arbitrary 0-delimited byte string.
* INTEGER -- An integer, in decimal representation unless otherwise
  noted.
* "a literal string" -- literal strings are contained within quotes.
* (VALUE | VALUE | ... ) -- a set of alternatives. Alternatives are
  separated by a "|" and all the alternatives are enclosed in "(" and
  ")".
* {VALUE, VALUE, ... } -- a list of possible values separated by "," and
  enclosed in "{" and "}".

Additional TAGS may follow as a comma separated set of the following
tags enclosed in square brackets.

* w -- Path is writable by the user. This capability is usually
  limited to the control domain (e.g. dom0).
* ARM | ARM32 | ARM64 | X86: the path is available for the respective
  architecture only.
* PV --  Path is valid for PV capable hypervisors only.
* HVM -- Path is valid for HVM capable hypervisors only.
* CONFIG_* -- Path is valid only in case the hypervisor was built with
  the respective config option.

So an entry could look like this:

    /cpu-bugs/active-pv/xpti = ("No"|{"dom0", "domU", "PCID on"}) [w,X86,PV]

Possible values would be "No" or a list of "dom0", "domU", and "PCID on".
The entry would be writable and it would exist on X86 only and only if the
hypervisor is configured to support PV guests.

## Example

A populated Xen hypervisor file system might look like the following example:

    /
        buildinfo/           directory containing build-time data
            config           contents of .config file used to build Xen
        cpu-bugs/            x86: directory of cpu bug information
            l1tf             "Vulnerable" or "Not vulnerable"
            mds              "Vulnerable" or "Not vulnerable"
            meltdown         "Vulnerable" or "Not vulnerable"
            spec-store-bypass "Vulnerable" or "Not vulnerable"
            spectre-v1       "Vulnerable" or "Not vulnerable"
            spectre-v2       "Vulnerable" or "Not vulnerable"
            mitigations/     directory of mitigation settings
                bti-thunk    "N/A", "RETPOLINE", "LFENCE" or "JMP"
                spec-ctrl    "No", "IBRS+" or IBRS-"
                ibpb         "No" or "Yes"
                l1d-flush    "No" or "Yes"
                md-clear     "No" or "VERW"
                l1tf-barrier "No" or "Yes"
            active-hvm/      directory for mitigations active in hvm doamins
                msr-spec-ctrl "No" or "Yes"
                rsb          "No" or "Yes"
                eager-fpu    "No" or "Yes"
                md-clear     "No" or "Yes"
            active-pv/       directory for mitigations active in pv doamins
                msr-spec-ctrl "No" or "Yes"
                rsb          "No" or "Yes"
                eager-fpu    "No" or "Yes"
                md-clear     "No" or "Yes"
                xpti         "No" or list of "dom0", "domU", "PCID on"
                l1tf-shadow  "No" or list of "dom0", "domU"
        params/              directory with hypervisor parameter values
                             (boot/runtime parameters)
